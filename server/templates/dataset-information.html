    <br><br>
    The data contains a sample of 540 healthy patients
    and 75 patients who were diagnosed with hepatitis C.<br><br> The healthy volunteers were recruited
    from Hannover Medical School and were exmained prior to being included in the study for factors such
    as liver disease, alcoholism, renal function and Hepatitis C itself (amongst other things). Participation
    was entirely voluntary and all patients gave written consent. Patients underwent a blood test which measured
    a variety of demographic data as well as liver function analysis, including liver enzyme activity, etc.
    <br><br>
    The following information about each of the patients was taken:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Age</b>: Exact age in years</li>
        <li><b>Sex</b>: [male,female] </li>
        <li><b>ALB</b>: Albumin (g/L)</li>
        <li><b>ALP</b>: Alkaline Phosphatase (IU/L)</li>
        <li><b>ALT</b>:Alanine Transaminase (IU/L)</li>
        <li><b>AST</b>: Aspartate Aminotransferase(IU/L)</li>
        <li><b>BIL</b>: Bilirubin (µmol/L)</li>
        <li><b>CHE</b>: Acetylcholinesterase(IU/L)</li>
        <li><b>CHOL</b>: Cholesterol(mmol/L)</li>
        <li><b>CREA</b>: Creatinine(µmol/L)</li>
        <li><b>CGT</b>: Gamma-glutamyl Transferase(U/L)</li>
        <li><b>PROT</b>: Protein(g/L)</li>
    </ul>
    The response variable was classified into 5 categories:
    <br>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Blood donor('0')</li>
        <li>Suspected blood donor ('0s')</li>
        <li>Hepatitis ('1')</li>
        <li>Fibrosis ('2')</li>
        <li>Cirrhosis ('3')</li>
    </ul>
    where the various levels denote the progression of Hepatitis C
